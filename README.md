🚀 My Top Projects

✈️ Flight Simulator – Real-Time Aircraft Telemetry System (C++)
C++17 | Linux | Multithreading | UDP Sockets | CMake

- Simulates real-time aircraft telemetry (altitude, speed, attitude, G-force, engine temp)
- Sends live telemetry packets via UDP to a mission-system module
- Multithreaded design for 10–50 Hz data generation and processing
- Includes anomaly detection (stall risk, over-G, high engine temp, etc.)
-  Built with CMake + runs on Linux to model real mission-computer environments
